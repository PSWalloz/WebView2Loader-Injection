Welcome

This is another injection method used for Roblox and it is Emulating WebView2Loader

It works by emulating the Exports of WebView2Loader and the main exploit code goes into the EntryPoint.cpp file

You can also make this work without emulating the exports and js having the exports by them selves but it wouldnt load webpages on Roblox

Anyways please give me credits for this and enjoy <3


# How to use
1. Open the project and set the build to Release and x64
2. Then build the project
3. After building it head too the Build folder Located in the same folder as the .sln
4. Then open the "take-two sign.bat" file and press Yes for administrator permission
5. After that in file-path: just type in "WebView2Loader.dll"
6. Then once it is finished press enter and once it closes move onto next step
7. Now it built you want to drag your Exploit WebView2Loader.dll into the Roblox directory and make sure you replace it
8. And now it should work so enjoy this method
