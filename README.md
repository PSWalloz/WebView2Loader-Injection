Welcome

This is another injection method used for Roblox and it is Emulating WebView2Loader

It works by emulating the Exports of WebView2Loader and the main exploit code goes into the EntryPoint.cpp file

You can also make this work without emulating the exports and js having the exports by them selves but it wouldnt load webpages on Roblox

Anyways please give me credits for this and enjoy <3
